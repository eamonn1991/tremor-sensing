Release Notes - Bean Android SDK - Version 2.1.0

## Features

* Public Bean API for reading HW/FW versions individually (instead of .readDeviceInfo())

* New interface for communicating to/from the OADProfile for FW updates
* Generic watchdog implementation, currently only used by OAD process

## Tests

* Added "pure Android" BLE test, used for debugging purposes only, which eliminates the use of the SDK itself
* Support in `TestBeanFirmwareUpdate` for Bean+
* Added instrumentation test for `BeanManager`
* Added instrumentation tests for new Bean API (`readHardwareVersion`, `readFirmwareVersion`)
